My name is Artur Lozovoi, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Professor Carlos Meriles at the City College of New York. My current research interest lies in the field quantum physics of defects in diamonds. In particular, I am working on exploring the possibilities of using nitrogen vacancies and substitutonal nitrogen in diamond lattice as qubits for qunatum communication and computing.
